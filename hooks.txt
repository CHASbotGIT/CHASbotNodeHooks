// Hook template options:
// =====================
// (1) [required] Is the name of the 'hook' lower_case with no spaces, as set as the action in dialogflow;
// (2) [required] The https URL to the image or the link to a webpage e.g. could be a link to a website, workplace group*, or just a picture;
// (3) [optional/required with button] The text to be sent along with the URL; and
// (4) [optional/required with button] If the URL in (2) is a link for a button, not just a picture, then the text for the button is also required.
// *treat groups with special care
// Use a line for each 'hook', seperate each of the values on the line with a $ dollar symbol, and otherwise don't use the $ symbol
// Use double forward slashes for lines that are ignored AND don't leave any blank lines
// e.g. picture only:
// pic_only_hook$https://www.linktopic.co.uk
